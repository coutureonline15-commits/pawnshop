      <h3>How does pawning an item work?</h3>
      <p>
        A pawn is a short-term, collateral-based loan. You bring in an item of value, the pawnbroker assesses its worth, and then offers you a loan based on a percentage of that value. The item serves as collateral. You get your item back once you repay the loan amount plus interest/fees by the agreed-upon due date.
      </p>

      <h3>What is the difference between pawning and selling?</h3>
      <p>
        Pawning means you take out a loan using your item as collateral, and you intend to pay back the loan to reclaim your item. You retain ownership during the loan period.<br>
        Selling means you transfer ownership of the item to the pawnshop immediately in exchange for cash, and you cannot retrieve the item later.
      </p>

      <h3>How do you determine the value of my item?</h3>
      <p>
        The pawnbroker assesses the item based on its current market value (what it would sell for used), its condition, and the demand for that specific item. They generally loan a percentage of the estimated resale value to protect their investment.
      </p>

      <h3>How much money can I get for my item?</h3>
      <p>
        Loan amounts vary widely but are typically a percentage of the item's estimated resale value (often 25% to 60%). The exact amount depends on the item, its condition, and the pawnshop's policies.
      </p>

      <h3>How long do I have to pay back the loan and get my item back?</h3>
      <p>
        Loan periods vary by state regulation, but are typically 30 days, sometimes with a grace period. Customers usually have options to renew or extend the loan by paying the accrued interest and fees.
      </p>

      <h3>What happens if I don't repay the loan?</h3>
      <p>
        If you choose not to pay back the loan or renew it by the due date, the pawnshop forfeits (takes legal ownership of) your collateral and may sell it to recover the money loaned. There are typically no legal consequences or negative impact on your credit score.
      </p>

      <h3>Is my item safe while it's in pawn?</h3>
      <p>
        Reputable pawnshops securely store and insure all collateral. Your item is typically kept in a safe or secure area until you redeem it.
      </p>

      <h3>Do I need a credit check to get a loan?</h3>
      <p>
        No. Pawn loans are based on the value of the collateral, not your credit history. The only requirement is typically a valid government-issued photo ID.
      </p>

      <h3>What items do you accept?</h3>
      <p>
        Pawnshops generally accept items that retain value and are easy to resell, such as gold and diamond jewelry, quality electronics (laptops, game systems), name-brand tools, and musical instruments. It's best to call ahead for a specific item.
      </p>

      <h3>Can I negotiate the loan amount or the price of items for sale?</h3>
      <p>
        Yes, negotiation is common in pawnshops, especially for high-value items. You can typically try to negotiate a higher loan offer for your collateral or a lower price on an item you wish to buy.
