          <dt>How does pawning an item work?</dt>
          <dd>A pawn is a short-term, collateral-based loan. You bring in an item of value, the pawnbroker assesses its worth, and then offers you a loan based on a percentage of that value. The item serves as collateral. You get your item back once you repay the loan amount plus interest/fees by the agreed-upon due date.</dd>

          <dt>What is the difference between pawning and selling?</dt>
          <dd>Pawning means you take out a loan using your item as collateral, and you intend to pay back the loan to reclaim your item. Selling means you transfer ownership of the item to the pawnshop immediately in exchange for cash, and you cannot retrieve the item later.</dd>

          <dt>How do you determine the value of my item?</dt>
          <dd>The pawnbroker assesses the item based on its current market value (what it would sell for used), its condition, and the demand for that specific item. They generally loan a percentage of the estimated resale value to protect their investment.</dd>

          <dt>How much money can I get for my item?</dt>
